I am Yijia Zhang, holding a Ph.D. from Boston University, with extensive experience in high-performance computing, cluster computing, energy efficiency optimization, and computing-electricity synergy. My research has been published in leading international conferences, including ASPLOS, EuroSys, IPDPS, DATE, and e-Energy. I am a recipient of the ISC Gauss Award and hold more than 10 patents.

Currently, I am a researcher at the Peng Cheng Laboratory, contributing to the development of AI computing clusters. My work has produced outcomes in optimizing the energy efficiency of AI clusters, modeling the performance and power consumption of AI processors, designing node architectures, and advancing computing-electricity co-design.

My ongoing research is driven by the following questions:

1. How can we enhance the performance of AI clusters and the parallel efficiency of AI tasks through co-design across architectural, systems, and algorithmic levels?

2. How to improve the energy efficiency of large-scale AI computing clusters?

3. How can hardware-software co-design holistically optimize AI computing systems in terms of computational power, memory access, and communication?

4. How can we leverage the synergy between computing systems and electricity to reduce the energy costs associated with AI workloads?
